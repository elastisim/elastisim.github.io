# ElastiSim

Resource and job management systems (often called batch systems, job schedulers, or workload managers) schedule jobs and provide resources in large-scale computing environments. ElastiSim is a batch-system simulator for malleable[^1] workloads, including the simulation of
- jobs and applications,
- the scheduling algorithm, and
- the platform (powered by [SimGrid](https://simgrid.org/)).

Using ElastiSim, users can evaluate policies for the combined scheduling of rigid, moldable, and malleable workloads. These pages introduce ElastiSim, give an overview of its functionalities, and provide a user manual, helping users to establish individual simulations.

[^1]: Another common term is *elastic*.
